The code simulates the neuronal activity of an excitatory and inhibitory network following topological details presented in Menesse and Torres (2024). 

# RUNNING EEG MODEL

Example notebook code for building the network with the specific topology used in Menesse y Torres (2023) and running a simulation.
Visualization_Example present scripts for visualization of neurons raster plot and membrane potential time series in 5 groups of neurons as done in Menesse y Torres (2023).

# JULIA FUNCTIONS
The script EEG_LIF_model.jl contains functions for creating the network and simulate its dynamic.
The script tau_mu_map.jl execute the functions to run the simulation given the values of two parameters of the model, the noise level mu and the synaptic resources recovery time scale tau_{rec}.

The output of the script gives:
  - File with average membrane potential time series of 5 groups of excitatory and inhibitory neurons.
  - File with binned time series of spiking state of N neurons of the network.
